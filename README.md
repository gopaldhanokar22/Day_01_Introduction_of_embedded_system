✳️What is embedded system? \
An embedded system is a specialized computing system designed to perform specific tasks within a larger system. It is typically a combination of hardware and software, often embedded into devices to control their functions. 

✳️Key Characteristics:
🔸Dedicated Functionality: Designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. \
🔸Real-time Operation: Often required to respond quickly to inputs and produce outputs within a defined time frame. \
🔸Resource-Constrained: Operates with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. \
🔸Reliability: High levels of reliability and efficiency are crucial for their intended applications. \
🔸Integration: Combines hardware and software tightly for optimized performance. 

✳️Core Components: \
1. Hardware: \
🔹Microcontroller: A small, integrated computer-on-a-chip containing a processor, memory, and I/O ports. \
🔹Microprocessor: Used in more complex systems, requiring external components like memory. \
🔹Sensors: Capture inputs from the environment (e.g., temperature, pressure). \
🔹Actuators: Perform actions based on decisions (e.g., motors, lights). \
🔹Power Supply: Provides the necessary electrical energy. 

2. Software: \
🔹Firmware: Programmed instructions that control hardware. \
🔹Operating System: Used in more advanced systems (e.g., RTOS - Real-Time Operating System). \
🔹Application Software: Implements the specific functions. 

✳️Examples: \
▪️Consumer Electronics: Washing machines, microwaves, smart TVs. \
▪️Automotive: Anti-lock braking systems (ABS), airbag controllers. \
▪️Medical Devices: Pacemakers, infusion pumps. \
▪️Industrial Automation: Robotics, conveyor belt systems. \
▪️IoT Devices: Smart home devices like thermostats and smart locks. 

✳️Advantages: \
▫️Low power consumption \
▫️Small size \
▫️High reliability \
▫️Cost-efficient for mass production 

✳️Disadvantages: \
▫️Limited upgradeability \
▫️Often requires specialized design and testing \
▫️May lack flexibility for additional functions
